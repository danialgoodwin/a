# Rhymes (and slant rhymes)
Attitude of gratitude
Cunning Linguists' cunnilingus
Clitoris Gibberish
Synonym, cinnamon, drinkin gin, M&M, this is sin, innocent, lack of zen, it's not open, with my pen, with a ten, for the win
fireworks, humidifier works
In a sense, innocence
This news, snooze
Lick her liquor lips
Clap your Haaandza .... For this stanza
fire (fiya); for you (for-ya)
Releasing , really seeing
Sin tax, syntax
propose porpoise purpose


# Homophones
access, axis
Prophets profit



# Weird


; Tune of Kokomo (aka, Aruba, Jamaica, oooh I wanna take ya)
Baloni, salami, oooh I like the deli

Possible lyrics
How far would you go to get away

; leaf-blower song (sang twangy)
Leaf-blower, leaf-blower, leave those leafs alone
Leaf-blower, leaf-blower, why are you so loud
Leaf-blower, leaf-blower, why are you so mean
Snow-plower, snow-plower, leave those leafs alone

I don't know what to do, but I do stuff anyways.

I'm losing control of mind body and soul

If there ever was a way,, we will find a way
If there ever was a won't.. we won't,, we won't,, we won't we will
