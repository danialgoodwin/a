# Tax notes
- Food is 50% deductible
- Be more specific on deduction categories
- Don't put things in misc
- Put more things in dues and subscriptions maybe
- Make things understandable for the lay person, don't just put brand names. Make domain names more specific so they don't look like duplicates
- Put automobile stuff under fuel to make things/forms simpler
