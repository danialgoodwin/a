Here's a collection of words that have motivated me:
- Do what you really want to do. Do it now.
- Flow
- Make everday a litle better
- Lower your barrier for getting things done

- How to start working despite not feeling like it:
    - "Okay, let's do this"
    - "Screw it, let's do it"
    - "Start sloppy; start deliberately bad" (easier to start this way and easier to continue)
- 1% better every day
- Specify goals
    - Do an action today
    - Write an action below each one, for today, for 3 weeks
- Video games are just pixels on a screen and don't add/further your life
- Don't waste time
- There's one thing to do, do it
- Make time for friends
- Start everyday as a producer, not a consumer
- Want to succeed as much as you want to breathe
- Take breaks and have fun so that you don't burn out
- Increase the amount of time you have by reducing the amount of time wasted
- If I'm not building, then my compoetitors are building
- What do I need to learn (or spend my time on) in order to succeed?
- "If you wake up and the first thing you realize it that you're going to die someday, then it puts you on your game for the day, saying, let's do stuff!"
- What am I motivated in?
- What's the absolute minimum visible (not viable) product that I can make and finish today? This week?
